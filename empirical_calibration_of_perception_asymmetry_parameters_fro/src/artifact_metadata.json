  "title": "Empirical Calibration of Perception Asymmetry Parameters from Outgroup Homogeneity Literature",
  "summary": "This research identifies robust empirical ranges for perception asymmetry parameters in opinion bubble models. The Boldry et al. (2007) meta-analysis of 12,078 participants establishes baseline effect sizes: perceived dispersion measures show Cohen's d \u2248 0.45 in natural groups (d \u2248 0.20 in minimal groups). The More in Common Perception Gap studies provide direct anchors: partisans show 50-58 percentage-point errors estimating single-item within-party agreement, with asymmetries strongest among high-engagement partisan \"Wings\" (3x worse than disengaged voters). Parameter calibration recommends: conservative \u03b1 \u2208 [0.1, 0.3] for minimal/weak conditions; typical \u03b1 \u2208 [0.4, 0.8] for real-world political contexts; extreme \u03b1 \u2208 [0.9, 1.5] for radicalized high-identity-salience environments. Critical moderators identified: political media consumption (Fox News viewers show ~20% larger gaps), educational attainment (increases gaps counterintuitively), network online diversity (buffers asymmetries), and engagement level (strong positive correlation). Measurement validation across Affective Polarization Scale (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.96), percentage estimation tasks, and feeling thermometers demonstrates reliable operationalization. Key gap: no direct studies measure \u03c3_ingroup/\u03c3_outgroup ratios quantitatively, limiting precision of calibration\u2014sensitivity analyses essential."
