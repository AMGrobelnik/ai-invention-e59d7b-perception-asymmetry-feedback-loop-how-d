  "title": "Asymmetric Bounded-Confidence Model for Opinion Dynamics with Perception Asymmetry",
  "summary": "This experiment implements an agent-based model testing three hypotheses about how perception asymmetry (\u03b1) affects opinion bubble stability in political networks. The model extends the classical bounded-confidence framework by reducing agents' willingness to engage with perceived outgroup members, simulating in-group/out-group perception biases. Key findings from 200 simulations across 10 random seeds and 20 \u03b1 values (0.1-1.43): (1) H1 Supported - Higher perception asymmetry correlates with increased opinion cluster lifetime (r=0.350, p<0.0001), indicating more stable echo chambers; (2) H2 Not Supported - No significant relationship between \u03b1 and final cluster count (r=-0.009, p=0.90); (3) H3 Partially Supported - Critical phase transition detected at \u03b1\u22480.55, above which cluster merger events become extremely rare. The model uses Watts-Strogatz small-world networks (N=100, k=6, p=0.15) with continuous opinion space [0,1], comparing METHOD (varying \u03b1) against BASELINE (\u03b1=0) conditions. Convergence defined as max opinion change <0.0005 for 50 consecutive steps. Results suggest perception asymmetry may be a key mechanism for echo chamber formation and persistence in online political discourse."
