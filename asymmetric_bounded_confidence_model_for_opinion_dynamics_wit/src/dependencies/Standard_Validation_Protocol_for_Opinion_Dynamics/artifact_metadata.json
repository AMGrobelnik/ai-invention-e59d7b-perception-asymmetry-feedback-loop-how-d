  "title": "Standard Validation Protocol for Opinion Dynamics Models: Metrics, Benchmarks, and Phase Transition Detection",
  "summary": "This comprehensive validation protocol synthesizes standard metrics, benchmarks, and phase transition detection approaches from 20+ peer-reviewed computational social science publications. Key findings: (1) Cluster stability uses smooth clustering metric c = 1/\u03a3(r_i\u00b2) with 20+ run validation; (2) Bounded confidence convergence requires mathematical conditions (self-confidence, symmetry, interior) with finite-time guarantees; (3) Phase transitions detected via critical slowing down (variance/autocorrelation peaks), bifurcation analysis with eigenvalue conditions, and early warning signals (multiplicative noise eliminates traditional EWS); (4) Standard networks: Watts-Strogatz p \u2208 [0.1,0.25] optimal, Barab\u00e1si-Albert \u03b1 \u2208 [2,3]; (5) Replication: 20+ runs, TSC \u2208 [1,30] steps, |m|\u22640.001 convergence slope; (6) Empirical validation requires BOTH macro R\u00b2>0.8 AND micro transition matrix D_micro matching. Provides actionable formulas, threshold values, and statistical testing protocols for opinion dynamics validation."
