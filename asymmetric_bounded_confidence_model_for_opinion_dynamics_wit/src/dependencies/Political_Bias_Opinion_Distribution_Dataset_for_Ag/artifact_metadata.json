  "title": "Political Bias Opinion Distribution Dataset for Agent Simulations",
  "summary": "This dataset provides 200 political statements with continuous opinion scores (-1.0 to +1.0) from the cajcodes/political-bias dataset, ideal for initializing agent-based opinion dynamics simulations. Each example contains: (1) input text with a political statement to classify, (2) context with opinion_score (continuous -1.0 to +1.0 scale), bias_category (far_right/right/center/left/far_left), and scale metadata, (3) output classification label. The dataset exhibits multimodal clustering with 5 distinct opinion clusters, matching the artifact objective of providing realistic initial conditions for opinion dynamics research. Label distribution: center (49), far_left (45), left (36), far_right (35), right (35). Use full_data_out.json for experiments, mini_data_out.json for quick testing, preview_data_out.json for inspection. Load via: json.load(open('full_data_out.json'))['examples']."
