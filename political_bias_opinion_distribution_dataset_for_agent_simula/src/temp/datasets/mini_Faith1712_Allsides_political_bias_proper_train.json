Elijah Cummings, D-Md., speaks during a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington in August.                  Patrick Semansky/AP                  Updated at 11:10 a.m. ET  Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, a Baltimore attorney and civil rights advocate who served in Maryland's legislature before representing the state in the U.S. House, where he took on a lead role in investigating President Trump, has died. He was 68.  Cummings, the head of the powerful House Committee on Oversight and Reform, died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital from complications related to longstanding health challenges, according to The Associated Press.  \"He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our problem,\" said Cummings' wife, Maryland Democratic Party Chair Maya Rockeymoore Cummings. It's been an honor to walk by his side on this incredible journey. I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly.\"   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Cummings \"my brother in Baltimore\" as she spoke about him on Thursday.  \"In the Congress, Elijah was considered a north star,\" Pelosi said. \"He was a leader of towering character and integrity.\" She added, \"He lived the American dream, and he wanted it for everyone else.\"   President Trump issued a statement via Twitter saying:  \"My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!\"  Former President Barack Obama issued his own statement saying, \"Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings.  \"As Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he showed us all not only the importance of checks and balances within our democracy, but also the necessity of good people stewarding it,\" Obama said.  The 12-term congressman had failed to return from an unspecified medical procedure and missed two legislative roll call votes on Tuesday, the first day after a two-week recess, according to The Baltimore Sun.  In a statement on Sept. 30, Cummings said his doctors expected him to be able to return to Washington \"when the House comes back into session in two weeks.\" It said he'd be in \"constant communication\" with his staff and congressional colleagues while he was away.  Cummings was among the three Democratic committee chairmen who signed a letter last month that accompanied a congressional subpoena of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of the president.   According to an official biography of Cummings, the Baltimore native attended Howard University, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in political science and served as student government president. He later obtained a law degree from the University of Maryland School of Law.  He served for 13 years in Maryland's House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in 1996.  \"Congressman Cummings has dedicated his life of service to uplifting and empowering the people he is sworn to represent,\" his official biography says.  \"He began his career of public service in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he served for 14 years and became the first African American in Maryland history to be named Speaker Pro Tem,\" it says. \"Since 1996, Congressman Cummings has proudly represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.\"  Cummings was born and raised in Baltimore and lived there his entire life in what he described as the \"inner inner city.\" He was one of seven children of parents who worked as sharecroppers before moving to the city in the 1940s, according to the Sun.  Discussing Cummings' connection with his constituents in Baltimore, Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, tells NPR's Noel King, \"he really was a moral force in the community.\"  \"People trusted him in the unrest after Freddie Gray was killed — it was Elijah Cummings who could walk into the crowd and be recognized and have people respond to him,\" Ifill says. \"And so I think what the country has seen of him over the last year is a reflection of what many of us here in Baltimore have known for the 20 years of his leadership. A man of tremendous, tremendous integrity.\"  As a prominent Democratic lawmaker, Cummings frequently found himself on the receiving end of Trump's Twitter account. In an infamous series of tweets in July, the president referred to Cummings' Baltimore district as \"rat and rodent infested\" and suggested that the congressman seldom goes there.        Elijah Cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through “Oversight.” He does NOTHING for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district! Take a look.... #BlacksForTrump2020 https://t.co/seNVESZUht— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019       \"Mr. President, I go home to my district daily,\" Cummings fired back in a letter to Trump. \"Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors.\"  Referring to investigations of the president, which he perceived as the true impetus for the derogatory remarks, Cummings said in the letter that it is \"my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.\"  Despite the president's remarks, Cummings continued to reach out to the White House and called on government officials to stop making \"hateful, incendiary comments\" that divide and distract.         Mr. President, we can address this together. Two years ago, I went to the White House to ask you to endorse my bill to let the government negotiate directly for lower drug prices.— Elijah E. Cummings (@RepCummings) July 27, 2019       When Democrats took the House in the 2018 election, political pundits had predicted that Cummings' chairmanship of the Oversight Committee would be a \"nightmare\" for Trump.  \"Are we going to be the nightmare? he mused in an interview with the Sun. \"It's in the eye of the beholder.\"  NPR's Casey Noenickx contributed to this report.",

Election watchers and Obama supporters in Times Square, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Iowa react to news that the president has won a second term. Via #WorldStream.                                                                                                           \nSee More Video on #WorldStream           For Republicans, it raises uncomfortable questions: What went wrong, and how did Democrats manage to blunt Mr. Romney's seemingly big advantage on what was easily the top issue for voters in the 2012 race?      Early analysis based on polls and other research by Democrats close to the Obama re-election effort suggests that Mr. Obama found multiple ways to chip away at the public's confidence in Mr. Romney, as well as his conservative policy prescriptions. That multifront effort succeeded in raising enough doubt about Mr. Romney—and sufficiently reinforcing Mr. Obama's own message—to allow the president to gain re-election.                Some top Republicans agreed they need to rethink how they present their economic message.      \"We need to do a better job of making our economic case\" in coming elections, GOP strategist Karl Rove said on Fox News on Wednesday morning. Mr. Rove said one reason Democrats succeeded was that they turned the presidential election into a tactical fight largely defined by negative attacks.      Mr. Rove noted that while Mr. Romney appeared to score well with voters in a number of categories, including his leadership and vision, Mr. Obama by the end held a lopsided advantage on the question of which candidate cares about people like them. Democrats succeeded in defining Mr. Romney as \"a rich guy who didn't care about them,\" Mr. Rove said.      Mr. Obama also was aided by a well-executed turnout effort, one that was all the more successful because of demographic shifts that are placing more electoral power in the hands of minority voters, who tended to support Mr. Obama by large margins.      His victory makes Mr. Obama the first president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 to succeed with a higher unemployment rate on Election Day than on his inauguration day four years earlier. U.S. unemployment now stands at 7.9%, compared with 7.8% when Mr. Obama took office.     A poll completed this week by Democratic pollster Geoff Garin—and funded by an independent group supporting Mr. Obama—suggested that the Obama campaign succeeded in part by persuading voters that Mr. Romney's economic policies would be bad for people like themselves. \"Only 38% of voters say that if Mitt Romney is elected president his economic policies will be good for people like them,\" the analysis says. \"By comparison, 44% say President Obama's policies will be good for people like them.\"     While a large majority of voters said they were dissatisfied with the economy, relatively few blamed Mr. Obama, pointing their fingers instead at Wall Street and the administration of former President George W. Bush. A narrow majority of voters said they believed the country was making progress economically, and those voters tended to side with Mr. Obama.     The Obama campaign also succeeded in undermining voter perceptions of Mr. Romney's tenure at Bain Capital, the private-equity firm he founded. \"In the final round of swing state polling…voters agreed by 17 points that 'as a businessman, (Romney's) priority was making millions for himself and his investors, regardless of the impact on jobs and the employees,' \" according to the Garin analysis.                                          After winning a second term, President Barack Obama ends his victory speech with his vision for the country during his speech.

Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.\"     John Mack, the former Morgan Stanley chief executive, suggested on Wednesday that after all the campaign-season criticism of business, Mr. Obama should enlist Mr. Romney's help in mending fences, particularly given the economy's ongoing problems.      \"I would love to see the president reach out and ask Mitt Romney to get involved in some way to work with the business community,\" Mr. Mack said on Bloomberg TV. \"If we could make some moves like that where we could work together…I think it's a huge positive.\"     In retaining the presidency, Mr. Obama, 51 years old, defeated the 65-year-old former Massachusetts governor, who had been seeking the office for six years.     \"We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future,\" the president said in a victory speech that came after 1:30 a.m. Eastern time. He said he would meet with Mr. Romney in the coming weeks to discuss various issues confronting the country.     \"I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader,\" Mr. Romney said in his concession speech.     Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who has been one of the president's primary adversaries in Congress, extended Mr. Obama a hand—with an admonition—in a statement issued early Wednesday.      \"The American people did two things: they gave President Obama a second chance to fix the problems that even he admits he failed to solve during his first four years in office, and they preserved Republican control of the House of Representatives,\" he said.      He made clear that Republicans are expecting the next four years to be different from the past four years. \"To the extent he wants to move to the political center…we'll be there to meet him half way. That begins by proposing a way for both parties to work together in avoiding the 'fiscal cliff' without harming a weak and fragile economy, and when that is behind us work with us to reform the tax code and our broken entitlement system,\" he said.

Greeting Mr. Obama will be a divided Congress. Democrats retained their Senate majority, while Republicans looked set to keep control of the House of Representatives. After the election, Washington remained aligned exactly as it was Tuesday morning, despite $6 billion in spending and 1.2 million political ads in the presidential race alone.     Americans handed Mr. Obama the job of navigating conflicting impulses in both Washington and the nation, a partisan divide the president has previously struggled to master.      Despite Mr. Romney's focus on the economy, pitching himself as a onetime businessman capable of fixing what ails the U.S., he couldn't overcome missteps and attacks from Democrats over his work as a private-equity executive.                At stake were two starkly different visions of the role of government and the recipe for economic revival. Mr. Romney called for reducing taxes and scaling back regulations, which he said would trigger economic growth.      Mr. Obama laid out a model of public investment in alternative energy and education, along with tax increases on wealthier families to help cut deficits. He has also voiced plans to pursue a revamp of U.S. immigration laws.     The president's re-election campaign was light on details of his second-term agenda, in contrast to the ambitious list he brought to the office in 2008.     Mr. Obama sealed his victory with wins in swing states including Ohio, Colorado and Virginia. He was running neck and neck in Florida.      The contest showed how dramatically the U.S. has changed in recent years. According to exit polls, Mr. Romney won 60% of the white vote. Mr. Obama won 38%, five points fewer than his 2008 showing. Not since Walter Mondale, who was swept aside by Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential race, has a Democrat recorded a smaller share of the white vote.                \nCasting Ballots in 2012Decision Day in America Voters headed to the polls Tuesday in a presidential contest defined by its intensity and razor-thin margins.                 \nReaders' Election PhotosView Election Day through the lenses of Journal readers, and share your photos with us on Twitter and Instagram with #WSJvote. More Photos           Mr. Obama will have little time to savor his victory. Looming almost immediately is the so-called fiscal cliff, a series of tax increase and spending cuts that come into force Jan. 1 and that could unravel the economy's fragile gains unless the president and congressional leaders engineer a compromise. The U.S. will also hit its borrowing limit in coming months, raising the prospect of a battle like the one last year that led to a downgrade of the U.S. debt rating.     Mr. Obama hopes to broker a far-reaching agreement, the kind of \"grand bargain\" that eluded him last year, which would include raising taxes on wealthier Americans. Republicans have said they would oppose any tax increase. The White House is already working to convene a meeting between the president and congressional leaders.      A key player will be Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Romney's running mate and a student of fiscal matters, who retained his House seat.     Mr. Obama notched a victory in a political climate that seemed ripe for his defeat. Polls showed more than half the population believed the U.S. was on the wrong track and that the government performed too many functions best done by the private sector—attitudes that would seem to benefit Republicans.     Mr. Obama was favored to win for most of the campaign, but the race narrowed in the final month after he turned in a lackluster performance in the first of three presidential debates.                                          Presidential historian Nick Ragone joins the News Hub to discuss Mitt Romney's loss and challenges the Republicans face. (Photo: Getty Images)                                                                                                     Mr. Romney closed the gap in the polls, raising the possibility that the nation's first African-American president might be voted from office at the end of a single term.     Mr. Obama prevailed through an aggressive and well-funded campaign. He championed middle-class interests while depicting Mr. Romney as an uncaring businessman whose economic policies would favor the wealthiest Americans.     The campaign's tone was coarse. Mr. Obama largely jettisoned the hopeful message of his 2008 campaign, convinced that to win he needed to paint Mr. Romney as an unpalatable alternative.      Mr. Obama's rise to power might have been dismissed as a fluke had he not secured a second term. His biography is nothing like that of recent predecessors. Mr. Obama was raised by a single mother and his grandparents. His father was from Kenya and his mother's family from Kansas. Mr. Obama spent most of his childhood in Hawaii, where he attended a prestigious private school. After graduating from Columbia University, he attended Harvard Law School, becoming the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review. He eventually moved to Chicago, where he became a community organizer and met his wife, first lady Michelle Obama.     His political resumé is short. He served in the Illinois state Senate until 2004, when he captivated the nation with a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. He was elected to the U.S. Senate that same year and hadn't served a full term before he won the White House in 2008.     His first term included passage of the health-care law, the financial-regulation bill and a series of interventions to save the banking system from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.     After the midterm elections in 2010, Republicans took charge of the House and Mr. Obama was forced to curb his ambitions.     The president has predicted that he would have better results in a second term. David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said any ill will from the election would quickly vanish.     Mr. Obama has said he would push several pieces of unfinished business left over the first term. He wants to pass an immigration overhaul that would provide a path to legal status for the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally.      Republicans might conclude it is in their interest to cooperate. In Tuesday's elections, the GOP got a lesson in the dangers of alienating Latinos. Many Republicans strategists have said the party must soften its stance on illegal immigration. Latinos now account for 16% of the population, and that figure is expected to jump to 22% by 2030.     With Hurricane Sandy ravaging the East Coast, Mr. Obama had a chance to show compassion to storm victims and deploy government resources to neighborhoods left in ruins. No less a critic than New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who gave the keynote speech at Mr. Romney's nominating convention, went out of his way to praise Mr. Obama's performance. About two-thirds of the public approved of the president's handling of Hurricane Sandy, a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll showed.     Worse for Mr. Romney, the storm froze the race at a moment when he had been gaining momentum and cutting into Mr. Obama's lead. Sandy diverted the nation's attention for days, forcing Mr. Romney to cancel some events and to juggle attacks on Obama with expressions of sympathy for storm victims.     Still, Mr. Obama's re-election would have seemed unlikely in the nadir of his presidency, the fall of 2010, when voters in the midterm election gave Republicans control of the House. Mr. Obama termed that election, \"a shellacking.\" White House advisers turned their attention to his political revival, knowing he was in a tough spot.     Unemployment hovered near 10%, and aides worried that independent voters had abandoned the president. Internal focus groups showed that voters didn't give credit to Mr. Obama for the stimulus program, even though many economists concluded that the measures staved off an even more serious downturn.     Aides settled on a strategy that emphasized steady improvement in the jobless rate while positioning Mr. Obama as a champion of the middle class.      Rather than save their money for the post-Labor Day race to November, the Obama campaign spent millions of dollars on TV ads attacking Mr. Romney for his record at Bain Capital. They painted him as a predatory capitalist who bought companies and laid people off in search of a quick profit.      Mr. Obama burned through a good chunk of his campaign cash, making some Democrats uneasy. But he made Mr. Romney unpopular among some voters.      In the end, Mr. Obama suffered no shortage of funds. In September alone, he took in $181 million in campaign donations. Altogether, the president and allied groups will have raised nearly $1 billion over the course of the campaign.     —Patrick O'Connor and Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.

    "text": "Infrastructure negotiations between President Biden and a group of Republicans led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) have officially broken down, and Biden now plans to turn his attention toward striking a deal with a separate, bipartisan group of senators, administration officials said Tuesday night.What we're hearing: When Biden and Capito spoke by phone on Tuesday, the call only lasted a few minutes, and it was clear that the two sides remain too far apart to find a compromise. The two parties still hadn't agreed on how to define what constitutes infrastructure, let alone set a price tag or way to pay for it.What they're saying: Biden \"informed Sen. Capito today that the latest offer from her group did not, in his view, meet the essential needs of our country,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.\"He offered his gratitude to her for her efforts and good faith conversations, but expressed his disappointment that, while he was willing to reduce his plan by more than $1 trillion, the Republican group had increased their proposed new investments by only $150 billion.\"“While I appreciate President Biden’s willingness to devote so much time and effort to these negotiations, he ultimately chose not to accept the very robust and targeted infrastructure package, and instead, end our discussions,\" Capito said.Timing: The Biden administration made clear they saw this week was the deadline for real progress on a deal with Capito and other GOP senators. Now he will focus on engaging the \"G20\" group of Democratic and Republican senators, led by Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).That group has floated a larger, $900 billion infrastructure proposal focused on roads, bridges and other traditional projects.Psaki said that Biden spoke with Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Sinema and Manchin today, and told the group he would continue to contact them by phone while in Europe over the next week.Biden also designated his Jobs Cabinet and White House aides Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell and Brian Deese to meet with them in person, Psaki added.Of note: The issue of how to pay for the package remains the major stumbling block.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that Democrats are working on a reconciliation bill as a backup plan in case talks fall through. He added that he plans to move forward with an infrastructure bill in the Senate in July, whether a deal between the two sides is reached or not.",
